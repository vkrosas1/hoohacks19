      The Basics of the Issue
    </h1>
  </head>

  <introtc>
    <p>
    In prisons, people often do not have access to tools for growth beyond their lifestyles that landed them in prison. Many ex-convicts have a hard time finding a job after they are freed, which can create cyclical criminal issues which people wouldn't choose if they had opportunities for non-deviant behavior. What this means is that we can change lives by helping connect people to jobs, affordable housing, financial education, and emotional support through the transition back into society.

    <h2>
      The Bail Trap: from the NYT
    </h2>
    <p1>
      Every year, thousands of innocent people are sent to jail only because they can’t afford to post bail, putting them at risk of losing 
      their jobs, families, and even their own lives. 
    </p1>
    <p2>
      Often for small crimes, people who do not have the money to post bail (think: people living paycheck to paycheck) 
      after being accused of a crime can either plead guilty for a reduced sentence, or they can wait in jail until their trial. 
      For the accused, that wait time means weeks of not having an income, and likely losing their job after not showing up for 
      several days and not being able to call their employer to explain the situation. If the accused was supposed to be providing 
      for a family, or worse if the accused was a single parent, there are huge ramifications for these people who cannot afford to 
      post bail. 
      People who cho0se to take a plea deal chose to have a criminal record, which means they will have a harder time finding work 
      and housing in the future, but it means they might be able to get back to their family or job rather quickly.
      People who choose to maintain their innocence spend weeks in jail before their case is heard, and sometimes even more weeks 
      before their release if evidence moves slowly. By the time they get out, many people have lost their jobs and custody of their 
      kids.

    <h2>
      Racial Issues: from the ACLU
    </h2>
    <p3>
      Racial profiling occurs every day and in every city, when law enforcement and private security target 
      people of color for detentions, interrogations, and searches without evidence of criminal 
      activity based on perceived race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion. Racial profiling is illegal, 
      violating the U.S. Constitution’s core promises of equal protection under the law to all and freedom from unreasonable 
      searches and seizures. Just as importantly, racial profiling is ineffective. It alienates communities from law enforcement, 
      hinders community policing efforts, and causes law enforcement to lose credibility and trust among the people they are sworn 
      to protect and serve.
    </p3>
    <h2>
      Problems with Prisons
    </h2>
    <p4>
      Prisons have high rates of rape, violence, prison gaurd abuse, and other negative activity which can severely impact 
      the mental health of prisoners. 
      The annual number of sexual assault reports from prisons has nearly tripled since 2010, which is a great sign for prisoners 
      being able to report the issues they face, but it is important to understand that the 25,000 people who report assaults need 
      our empathy and support, particularly when they head back into a more civil environment outside the prison life they've had 
      to adapt to survive through. 
      Prison violence also forces inmates to adopt a guarded mentality which makes it hard to be a good parent or employee when 
      they have learned that they are only safe by themselves. Particularly when violence has come from the guards, ex-convicts develop 
      problems with trusting authority. Being patient with these people and treating them humanely is key to helping them readjust to 
      society.

    <h2>
      Post-Release Hardships
    </h2>
    <p5>
      When people are released, they are often coming back into the world without a job. Sometimes, in addition to job searching, 
      they have lost their housing and belongings because they couldn't pay rent while they were imprisoned. Some people are also 
      coming back needing to fight for custody of their kids. These people are human, and while they may have made a mistake, or may 
      have chosen to plead guilty to spend less time away from their lives, they don't deserve to be punished for the rest of their 
      lives without access to jobs, peer respect, and personal growth. No one should be defined by the worst thing they've ever done. 
      Forgiveness and building a path forward are what we are all about here at the Hope Jar. 
      You can help by listing a job, donating to the cause<!-- insert a dummy link if we want-->, and being more empathetic and kind 
      next time you have the opportunity to show kindess to someone going through a rough patch in their life.
