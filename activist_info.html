      The Basics of the Issue
    </h1>
  </head>

  <introtc>
    <p>
    In prisons, people often do not have access to tools for growth beyond their lifestyles that landed them in prison. Many ex-convicts have a hard time finding a job after they are freed, which can create cyclical criminal issues which people wouldn't choose if they had opportunities for non-deviant behavior. What this means is that we can change lives by helping connect people to jobs, affordable housing, financial education, and emotional support through the transition back into society.

      The Bail Trap-
    </h2>
    <p1>
      Every year, thousands of innocent people are sent to jail only because they canâ€™t afford to post bail, putting them at risk of losing their jobs, families, and even their own lives. 
    </p1>
    <p2>
      Often for small crimes, people who do not have the money to post bail (think: people living paycheck to paycheck) after being accused of a crime can either plead guilty for a reduced sentence, or they can wait in jail until their trial. For the accused, that wait time means weeks of not having an income, and likely losing their job after not showing up for several days and not being able to call their employer to explain the situation. If the accused was supposed to be providing for a family, or worse if the accused was a single parent, there are huge ramifications for these people who cannot afford to post bail. 
      People who cho0se to take a plea deal chose to have a criminal record, which means they will have a harder time finding work and housing in the future, but it means they might be able to get back to their family or job rather quickly.
      People who choose to maintain their innocence spend weeks in jail before their case is heard, and sometimes even more weeks before their release if evidence moves slowly. By the time they get out, many people have lost their jobs and custody of their kids.

    <h2>
      Racial Issues
    </h2>
    <p3>
      Racial profiling causes the wrongful arrests of minorites, and allows many criminals to get away with wrongdoing on the assumption from police that they are law-abiding.

      Problems with Prisons
    </h2>
    <p4>
      Prisons have high rates of rape, violence, prison gaurd abuse, gangs, and other negative activity which can severely impact the mental health of prisoners. 
    </p4>
    <h2>
      Post-Release Hardships
    </h2>
    <p5>
      When people are released, they are often coming back into the world without a job. Sometimes, in addition to job searching, they have lost their housing and belongings because they couldn't pay rent while they were imprisoned. Some people are also coming back needing to fight for custody of their kids.
