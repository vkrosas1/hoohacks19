<h1>The Hope JAR</h1>

<p>
        The Hope J(ustice)A(nd)R(eform) is a project that seeks 
        <br>
        to provide ex convicts a means of restarting their life 
        <br>
        after finishing their prison sentence. It allows them to 
        <br>
        finish a certification/module that shows that they have 
        <br>
        reformed and have the qualifications to work for employers. 
        <br>
        The website gives employers a place to post jobs and ex 
        <br>
        convicts a place to post their job profiles. The website 
        <br>
        then matches the employer/employee based on the criteria. 
        <br>
        The project is also a means of educating the public on 
        <br>
        prison reform movements so that other people can make a 
        <br>
        difference as well. Our mission is to make a positive
        <br>
        impact on the ex-convicts life by giving them a second
        <br>
        chance while educating people on the injustices of the
        <br>
        prison system.
