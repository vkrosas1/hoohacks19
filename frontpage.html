<h1>The Hope JAR</h1>

<p>The Hope JAR's(Justice and Reform) mission is to provide an 
    easy way for ex-convicts to <br> find jobs post serving their sentence. 
    We hope to educate <br> people on prison reform and provide employers to find <br> good fits for their jobs.
    After the convict is done serving his/her <br> sentence we have them complete a module/certification <br>
    that asserts that they have finished their sentence and shown <br>good behavior and are ready
    to start their new life. We want our<br> system to give hope to people and provide them with a means for <br>
    restarting their life in a positive manner.</p>
