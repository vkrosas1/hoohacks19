<h1>Job Reform for Prisoners</h1>

<p>Our mission is to provide an easy way for ex-convicts to find jobs post serving their sentence. 
    <br>We hope to educate people on prison reform and provide employers to find good fits<br> for their jobs.
    After the convict is done serving his/her sentence we have them complete<br> a module/certification 
    that asserts that they have finished their sentence and shown good behavior<br> and are ready
    to start their new life. We want our system to give hope to people and provide<br> them with a means for 
    restarting their life in a positive manner.</p>
